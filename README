# Run Predictor & Data Insights

This code:
- **Automatically fetch your recent Strava runs**
- **Predict your race times (5K, 10K, Half Marathon, Marathon) using machine learning**
- **Explore your run data with simple analytics**

Files

`run_predictor_strava.py`
- Connects to the Strava API (using credentials and refresh token)
- Downloads your 30 most recent runs and stores them in a local SQLite database (`runs.db`)
- Trains a regression model on your run history
- Predicts your likely finish times for common race distances (5K, 10K, 13.1 Miles, 26.2 Miles).

`answer.py`
- Connects to the same `runs.db` database
- Answers interesting questions about your run data, such as:
  - What is your average run distance?
  - What are your 10 most common run distances?

Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   
   pip install requests scikit-learn numpy
   

2. **Get your Strava API credentials:**
   - Register an app at [Strava API settings](https://www.strava.com/settings/api)
   - Authorize your app with the `activity:read_all` scope
   - Obtain your `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, and `REFRESH_TOKEN`

3. **Configure `run_predictor_ml_strava.py`:**
   - Edit the file and fill in your Strava credentials at the top.

4. **Run the predictor:**
   
   python run_predictor_ml_strava.py
   
   - This will fetch your runs, update the database, and print your predicted race times.

5. **Explore your data:**
   
   python answer.py
   
   - This will print your average run distance and your most common run distances.

Notes

- Utilizes Python NumPy for computing.
- Database provided by SQLite
- Machine learning algorithm is implemented by using the LinearRegression class from scikit-learn Python libray.
- Struggling with connecting to Strava API consistently getting Token errors
- The scripts only access your own Strava data (the account that authorized your app).
- Your run data is stored locally in `runs.db`.
